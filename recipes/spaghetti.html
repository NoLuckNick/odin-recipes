     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>Ahhhhh spaghetti... A classic dish I'm sure we all have had a million times over, yet it continues
        to be a staple in our adult lives. This easy recipe is 3 (or 4 depending on how you like it) recipe
        will help you make a nice meal for the kids or a nice easy stay at home meal with the better half
        (which is my Wife in this case).</p>
